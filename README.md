## Machine Learning Predictions on eBay Auctions & CIFAR-10 Image Classification
This repository contains two independent machine learning tasks for the semester project in Machine Learning: Methods and Algorithms (2024-2025) at the University of Piraeus:

### eBay Auction Predictions

* Predicting whether an auction will result in a sale.
* Estimating the final price of a successful auction.
* Classifying whether an auctionâ€™s closing price is above or below the average.

### CIFAR-10 Image Classification

* Training machine learning models to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset.

Although these tasks are unrelated in terms of data and objectives, they share common machine learning principles and techniques. This repository is structured to keep both projects separate while leveraging a unified workflow and best practices for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
